    An academic year has two semesters (winter and summer) within which three examination periods are planned. Winter semester begins in the first week of October and lasts up to mid-January (around 15 January), which is 15 weeks. Classes in the summer semester begin in mid-February and end in late June of the same year.

    Between these two semesters, there is a January-February examination period which is organized in two phases:

    1st examination term – begins in mid-January and lasts up to the end of the month, which is around 2 weeks.

    2nd examination term - begins in early February and takes 2 weeks, which means that it lasts up to mid-February.

    The summer semester is followed by the two examination periods:

    June-July examination period that begins in early June and goes on up to the mid-July. This is the longest examination period (approximately 7 weeks).

    September examination period begins in the second half of August and goes on up to early October. This period is somewhat shorter when compared to the June-July examination period (around 5 weeks).

    There are two periods foreseen for the vacations. The first one is synchronized with the January-February examination period, and the second one takes place between June-July and September examination periods.
