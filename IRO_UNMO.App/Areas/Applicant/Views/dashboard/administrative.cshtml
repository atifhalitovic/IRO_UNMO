    Foreign students, who intend to study in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have to meet demands and conditions foreseen by the regulations on visa issuing. This means that they are obliged to fulfill the requirements foreseen by the provisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of safety.

    A student can get a permit to reside in Bosnia and Herzegovina for three months and if a student intends to reside longer, he is obliged to submit a request for one year-visa 15 days prior to the expiry of the three-month residence permit. Both requests must be submitted to the Field office of Ministry of safety located in Mostar.
